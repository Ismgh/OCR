# OCR
An OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system is a piece of software that can take images of handwritten characters as input and interpret them into machine readable text. While you may not think twice when depositing a handwritten cheque into a bank machine 
creating a web-based, client-server system that would handle user requests to train or test the OCR, the client would interpret the drawn pixels into an array and perform an HTTP request to the OCR server to perform the training or testing.
